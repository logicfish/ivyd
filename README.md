Functional stackable substrates in D 

These are templates as in the "Range" paradigm, which operate on concurrent processing stacks.
Substrates are arranged in a heirarchy and connected via channels. 

Substrates are grouped via containers, and implemented using Stacks.

A container is a tree of substrate definitions, and is generated by the compiler. A client would create
the stacking method overrides for each type that they want to use for a substrate binding.
The stack generates match functions for the input bindings and defines a fiber function for each potential
invokation. These are converted into a tuple of matching rules, and we can add our own rules and fibers.

Channel inputs are tuple patterns which evoke signals on concurrent processing fibres. The fibres 
are created by the Stack and when an input event becomes available, each matching fibre receives a
message containing the input value or state from the channel.
